SR 11-7 Model Risk Management System

End-to-End Quantitative Risk, Validation, Monitoring \& Governance Platform

--
Overview



This repository implements a production-grade Model Risk Management (MRM) system inspired by the SR 11-7 regulatory framework, covering the entire lifecycle of quantitative financial models:



Architecture → Model Development → Independent Validation → Ongoing Monitoring → Governance \& Audit



The project is designed as a final-year B.Tech capstone and is fully aligned with MSc Quantitative Finance / Financial Engineering expectations.



Unlike typical academic projects that stop at model computation, this system emphasizes model trustworthiness, statistical validation, monitoring, and governance — the core of real-world quantitative risk management.







Key Objectives



Build mathematically sound risk models



Enforce independent validation (no self-validation)



Detect model deterioration over time



Maintain auditability and governance discipline



Present results through a clean, minimal interface



Core insight:



In real quantitative finance, building the model is only a small part. Most of the work lies in validating, monitoring, and governing models.







 Quantitative Concepts Explained (Beginner Friendly)

| Concept                 | Meaning                                                    | Where Implemented |

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |

| \*\*VaR (Value at Risk)\*\* | Maximum expected loss over a horizon at a given confidence | Phase 2           |

| \*\*Historical VaR\*\*      | Empirical quantile of historical P\&L                       | Phase 2           |

| \*\*Monte Carlo VaR\*\*     | Parametric simulation using statistical assumptions        | Phase 2           |

| \*\*Backtesting\*\*         | Comparing predicted risk vs realized outcomes              | Phase 3           |

| \*\*Kupiec Test (POF)\*\*   | χ² test for VaR breach frequency                           | Phase 3           |

| \*\*Basel Traffic Light\*\* | Regulatory model performance classification                | Phase 3           |

| \*\*Model Drift\*\*         | Deterioration of model performance over time               | Phase 4           |

| \*\*Model Governance\*\*    | Ownership, approval, auditability                          | Phase 5           |





Phase 1 → Architecture \& Governance Design

Phase 2 → Risk Model Development (C++)

Phase 3 → Independent Validation (Python)

Phase 4 → Ongoing Monitoring \& Drift Detection

Phase 5 → Governance, Audit \& User Interface





Pillar 1 (Model Development) → C++ Risk Engine

Pillar 2 (Independent Validation) → Python Validation Engine

Pillar 3 (Ongoing Monitoring \& Governance) → Monitoring + Dashboard + Audit





Phase-by-Phase Breakdown



🔹 Phase 1 — Architecture \& Governance Foundation



Designed system structure before coding



Defined model lifecycle states



Created model inventory and audit framework



Enforced separation of responsibilities







🔹 Phase 2 — Risk Model Development (C++)



Models implemented:



Portfolio P\&L aggregation



Historical VaR (non-parametric)



Monte Carlo VaR (parametric simulation)



Design principles:



Deterministic outputs



Reproducible results



No validation logic inside the risk engine



Outputs written as immutable CSVs







🔹 Phase 3 — Independent Model Validation (Python)



Validation methods:



VaR backtesting



Kupiec Proportion of Failures test



Basel Traffic Light classification



Benchmark comparison between models



Key rule enforced:



Validation code never recalculates VaR — it only evaluates outputs from Phase 2.



Models are explicitly accepted or rejected based on statistical evidence.







🔹 Phase 4 — Ongoing Monitoring \& Drift Detection



Monitoring features:



Rolling breach windows (30 / 60 / 90 days)



Volatility and stability tracking



Alert classification (Healthy / Watch / Escalate)



Early-warning signals for deterioration



This phase answers:



“Is the model still behaving as expected today?”







🔹 Phase 5 — Governance, Audit \& User Interface



Governance features:



Model inventory with ownership and lifecycle state



Approval workflow



Append-only audit logs



Executive summaries



Interface:



Lightweight Flask backend



Minimal HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard



Upload-and-view functionality only



No recalculation or parameter changes via UI



This phase enables auditability without touching the models.

Final Note



This project shows that quantitative finance is not just about building models, but about:



validating them, monitoring them, governing them, and knowing when to reject them.
